## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not create a public issue.**  
   Instead, email us directly at [your-security-email@example.com] or use our private security issue tracker (if available).

2. **Include as much detail as possible.**  
   Please describe the vulnerability, its impact, affected versions, and steps to reproduce it.

3. **Expected Response Time:**  
   We aim to acknowledge your report within 2 business days. Updates on the investigation and remediation will be provided at least once a week until resolution.

4. **What Happens Next:**  
   - If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work with you to resolve it as quickly as possible.
   - After a fix is implemented, we will credit you (unless you request otherwise) and issue a security release.
   - If the report is not accepted, we will provide a clear explanation.
